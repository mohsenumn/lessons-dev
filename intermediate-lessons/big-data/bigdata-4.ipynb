But if the data was stored in the order D,A,C,B or any other combination with D as the first geometry then there will be only one comparison (assuming there are no overlapping polygons!!). We could always argue that we could plot and check which polygon contains the point, but it will become a daunting task once there are many points and many polygons. \n",

And at the end, all the partial results can be combined together to generate the final results. This is a very powerful paradigm and can be used to solve very large problems. You can, in theory send these chunks to different threads/cores/or even machines to generate partial results which can all be stitched back to get the final results. Ok, enough of theory, let's see this in action. \n"
