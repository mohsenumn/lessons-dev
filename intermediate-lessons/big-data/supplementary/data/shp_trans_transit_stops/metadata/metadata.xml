Stops where boarding and/or alighting occurs are flagged in the busstop_yn field.

The dataset includes attributes from the primary transit stop database maintained for Metro Transit and for customer information for other transit provider transit services.  The locations are mapped referencing MRCC Street Centerline network along with streets generated internally at Metro Transit.  </abstract><purpose>To identify all stop locations in the Twin Cities metropolitan area where transit service exists. </purpose><supplinf>Twin Cities 7-county metropolitan area plus two non-metro counties.

UNIQUE_ID: the street identification number the stop is localized on. Numbers match the road centerlines served on the MN Geospatial Commons, which has adopted the GAC standard. Please note that some IDs are custom HASTUS generated during street adjustment process.

side_id:  The primary key field and unique stop identification number assigned by Metro Transit.
 
site_on:  The street or address where the stop is found.
 
site_at:  The cross street or address nearest the stop.
 
corn_desc:  The description of the corner the bus stop is on.

city:  The city the stop is located in. 

county: The county where the stop is located in.

publiccomm:  Miscellaneous oomments about the stop.

dt_zone:  The stop is part of the 50-cent Downtown Fare Zone.

parkride:  The bus stop is at a park &amp; ride.

adaaccess:  The stop has a firm surface.

busstop_yn: Indicates whether boarding and alighting may occur at a stop. This is used to filter out timepoints and control points used in Metro Transit Scheduling.

node_id:  For those sites that are nodes, this field contains their four letter identification.  Nodes are often timepoints, or places where the bus has to arrive/depart at a certain time.  Note, however, that more than one site can have the same Nodeid because a route will use different sites in different directions. 

gate: The gate letter or number used for distinguishing stops at specific areas.

T_Code: Transit code TxBase facility identifier. There are cases where stops are associated with a facility. This identifier establishes the relationship between the stop and the facility. 

board_flag: this flag indicates if any bus trip allows boarding at the stop. 0 = No; 1 = Yes

alight_flag: this flag indicates if any bus trip allows alighting at the stop. 0 = No; 1 = Yes

active_status: indicates whether stop is active or archived. Active is defined as an available stop for Metro Transit scheduling department. Archived defined as stop that has been eliminated indefinitely for schedules. 

itinerary_yn: indicates whether a stops is part of Service Week's active itinerary. Itinerary is defined as the route/path taken from one stop to the next stop.

route_provider: indicates the line provider that serves the stop. Metro Transit trumps other providers if there are multiple providers servicing the stop. Met Council trumps other providers besides Metro Transit if there are multiple providers servicing a stop. Therefore, if just Metro Transit and just Met Council appear as value, it does not mean the sole provider for that stop. </eaover></overview></eainfo><spref><horizsys><planar><gridsys><gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn><utm><utmzone>15</utmzone></utm></gridsys><planci><plandu>meters</plandu></planci></planar><geodetic><horizdn>NAD83</horizdn><ellips>GRS80</ellips></geodetic></horizsys></spref></metadata>
