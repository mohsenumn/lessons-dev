We use lots of terms for making sense of data: processing data, filtering data, querying data, analyzing data, data munging, and visualizing data are just a few examples. \n",

    "To get the fastest time in this scenario requires two things. First, both Parker and Patricia need to be moving as quickly as possible, which means they are going the same speed: fast. Second, they need to have the same amount of work. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first requirement gives us an example of **processing speed** that we learned about earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second requirement gives us an example of **load balancing.** Load balancing ensures that each core is processing its fair share of data, which will make parallel computation faster. Just as we saw with Parker and Patricia if they are both working to plant their portion of the field simultaneously the entire field is planted faster. If only Patricia is planting the field and Parker is not helping, then it takes longer because she is doing all of the work and Parker is doing no work. This is improper load balancing. The same is true in parallel computation. If we have two or more cores that are capable of processing data and we only use one core, then the other cores are not helping to speed up the computation."
